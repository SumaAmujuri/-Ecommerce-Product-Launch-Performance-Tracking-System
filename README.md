# -Ecommerce-Product-Launch-Performance-Tracking-System
Business Problem:
A mid-sized e-commerce company needed to streamline the launch of a new Eco-Friendly Home Essentials product line and required real-time visibility into post-launch performance. The existing reporting methods were manual and delayed, limiting the ability to track sales targets, customer engagement, and inventory levels effectively.

Solution:
Led the end-to-end management of the product launch, coordinating cross-functional teams across Product, Marketing, and Supply Chain. Post-launch, developed a dynamic Power BI dashboard by leveraging SQL for data preparation, enabling stakeholders to monitor:

Sales vs. Budget Targets

Top-Selling Products

Customer Segmentation Insights

Regional Sales Distribution

Inventory Alerts for Low Stock Products

Integrated interactive filters for real-time, data-driven decision-making.
